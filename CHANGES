# Version 2 (2024-02-11):
  - Uninstalls widgets instead of disabling via GP registry key.
  - Disables web search from start menu.
  - Provided switch parameters to skip registry hacks, activation, application removal, and application installations.
  - Provided switch parameter to force uninstall of "VM-only" uninstalls on a potential non-vm system.

  - Massgrave activation disclaimer added.
